# Portfolio
Hi, my name is Aaron Tang and I am Master's of Science C.S. student at Cal State Fullerton! This portfolio project is a representation of who I am and what I have accomplished. 

This site is currently built with vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS. As I progress my skills, I will look to update this with different libraries and tech stacks I've learned.
